## About Me
I recently completed my Master’s in Astronomy at IIT Indore, where my research focused on **high-resolution HI 21-cm absorption studies** of the **multiphase interstellar medium** using large radio datasets. My work combined **observational astronomy**, **data analysis**, and **statistical modeling** to study galaxy evolution through neutral hydrogen.

Alongside research, I enjoy expanding my knowledge in **Bayesian inference** and its applications in astronomy. I also enjoy writing Python scripts to automate and analyze radio data (using tools like CASA), and working on open science problems. I’m currently preparing for a PhD, where I aim to deepen my understanding of the universe and continue working at the intersection of astronomy, statistics, and computation.
